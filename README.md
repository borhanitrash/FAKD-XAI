FAKD-XAI: Feature-Aligned Knowledge Distillation with Explainable AI for Efficient Brain Tumor Classification
## Abstract
Accurate and efficient classification of brain tumors via scans from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical follow-up and treatment planning. However, in deep learning models, computation costs are often a significant barrier to practical application. This paper presents **Feature-Aligned Knowledge Distillation with XAI (FAKD-XAI)**, a novel framework that classifies and rationally interprets brain tumors in an efficient manner. FAKD-XAI combines logit-level Knowledge Distillation with an adaptive intermediate feature-level distillation from **ResNet-50** (Teacher Model) to a lightweight **MobileNetV3-Large** (Student Model) to facilitate learning between complex and simple models. Our alignment module featuring a `1×1` convolution layer was able to overcome the student model's architectural divergences and enabled the efficient use of stratified feature transfer at different levels of the hierarchy. FAKD-XAI integrates **Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)**, which enhances the understanding of the workings behind model predictions, leading to increased trust from clinicians. FAKD-XAI achieved an accuracy of **99.47%** while remaining computationally tractable for practical, clinical deployment. The use of **Explainable AI (XAI)** confirms that the model focuses on pertinent tumor areas, suggesting FAKD-XAI’s usefulness as a reliable diagnostic aid.
