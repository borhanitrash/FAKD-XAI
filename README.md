FAKD-XAI: Feature-Aligned Knowledge Distillation with Explainable AI for Efficient Brain Tumor Classification
## Abstract
Accurate and efficient classification of brain tumors via scans from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical follow-up and treatment planning. However, in deep learning models, computation costs are often a significant barrier to practical application. This paper presents **Feature-Aligned Knowledge Distillation with XAI (FAKD-XAI)**, a novel framework that classifies and rationally interprets brain tumors in an efficient manner. FAKD-XAI combines logit-level knowledge distillation with adaptive intermediate feature-level distillation from a **ResNet-50** (teacher model) to a lightweight **MobileNetV3-Large** (student model), enabling effective learning between complex and simple models. An alignment module featuring a **1×1 convolution** layer addresses architectural differences in the student model, allowing efficient stratified feature transfer across multiple hierarchy levels. FAKD-XAI also integrates **Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)**, enhancing interpretability and fostering trust among clinicians by providing insight into model decisions. The framework achieved an accuracy of **99.47%**, while remaining computationally efficient for practical, clinical deployment. The use of **Explainable AI (XAI)** confirms that the model focuses on relevant tumor regions, highlighting FAKD-XAI’s potential as a reliable diagnostic aid.
